## About Me
I am a dedicated Data Science graduate with expertise in Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow), Java, Git, SQL, JMP, Mathematica, and C++. I have a strong academic background, holding an M.S. in Data Science from Rochester Institute of Technology and a B.S. in Data Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal.

## Bachelor's Thesis: TELI - Teacher-Ensemble Distillation based Learned Label Interpolation
[Read More](https://medium.com/@dubemanas10)

### Overview
TELI is a neural network learning strategy that combines the wisdom of multiple teacher models to enrich the model's understanding of data relationships.

### Key Features
- Knowledge Distillation: Model learns from labeled data and distills knowledge from a group of teacher models.
- Meta Learning: Dynamically tunes mixing ratio (lambda) between teacher predictions for adaptability.
- Teacher Ensemble: Ensembles multiple teacher models to strengthen the model's grasp of patterns.

### Achievements
- Utilized heavyweight and lightweight neural networks (e.g., VGG-16, ResNet-50, Masked Auto Encoders).
- Improved the robustness of the semi-supervised student model with Stochastic Data Augmentation by 2%.
- Boosted the student model performance by 12% through knowledge distillation.
- Presented the research at the university's Data Science board.
