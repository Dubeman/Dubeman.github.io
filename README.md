### ![TELI methodology](/assets/img/TELI.jpeg)

TELI is a neural network learning strategy that combines the wisdom of multiple teacher models to enrich the model's understanding of data relationships.

### Key Features
- Knowledge Distillation: Model learns from labeled data and distills knowledge from a group of teacher models.
- Meta Learning: Dynamically tunes mixing ratio (lambda) between teacher predictions for adaptability.
- Teacher Ensemble: Ensembles multiple teacher models to strengthen the model's grasp of patterns.

### Achievements
- Utilized heavyweight and lightweight neural networks (e.g., VGG-16, ResNet-50, Masked Auto Encoders).
- Improved the robustness of the semi-supervised student model with Stochastic Data Augmentation by 2%.
- Boosted the student model performance by 12% through knowledge distillation.
- Presented the research at the university's Data Science board.
